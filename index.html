        <p>This is an updated roster and statistics of the NBA team, the Los Angeles Lakers. This website is going to start out simple since I am new to HTML and the anatomy of it, but as I progress I want it to look more formal and multi-layered.</p>
        <p>Some of the statistics will be average</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>points</strong></li>
            <li><strong>assists</strong></li>
            <li><strong>rebounds</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>of the players from each game of the current season.</p>
