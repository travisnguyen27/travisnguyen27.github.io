        <p> I started creating this website last year and with the recent passing of Kobe Bryant, I</p>
        <p> wanted to finish the website in honor.This is an updated roster and statistics of the NBA </p>
        <p> team, the Los Angeles Lakers. This website is going to start out simple since I am new to</p>
        <p> HTML and the anatomy of it, but as I progress I want it to look more formal and multi-layered.</p>
        <p>The statistics will be career averages including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>points</strong></li>
            <li><strong>assists</strong></li>
            <li><strong>rebounds</strong></li>
        </ul>
